excerpt: I reflected on my recent first opera experience.

## Browsing Programs at Met Opera

I always loved music growing up but had never had a chance to see an opera. My hometown was too small for an opera production to come to perform. Also, even when I visited bigger cities, I prioritised seeing orchestra concerts over operas just because I was more familiar with orchestra and chamber music. But now that live in New York City, I’ve decided to take advantage of it and finally give myself an opera experience.

The first program that caught my attention when I visited the website of the Metropolitan Opera, was "Le Nozze Di Figaro", one of the masterpieces of Mozart. Although I have never seen the opera performance itself, I have been a big fan of some of the music pieces such as the famous overture and ‘Se Voul Ballare’. I put it on my must-go list.

## Rush Tickets are a great deal!

As I was looking through the ticket options, I learned they offered something called “<a href="https://www.metopera.org/season/tickets/rush-page" target="_blank">Rush Tickets</a>” at Met Opera. The idea is that they sell tickets for remaining orchestra seats for $25 (normal price range: $100-$300) on the day of the show at noon. It is a first-come, first-served basis, so you need to be logged in and ready by noon and click as soon as the clock hands meet. When I learned about these tickets, all of the programs offered right now went into my must-go list. I participated in this “click-war (a common expression in the Japanese language)” and won myself an orchestra seat for “Rigoletto”, which thus became my first opera show ever.

## Some Prep for Rigoletto

Embarrassingly, I did not know anything about Rigoletto and thus did some reading about it so that I would be able to follow the plot and pay more attention to the performance. The Met Opera’s website offers a description of the piece as well as the current production. As I was reading about it, I learned that the performance is reset by Barlett Sher, the director in 1920s Weimar Germany, with Art Deco sets. My colleague, who is a lot more well-versed in design and architecture than me told me that Art Deco is a style of visual arts. The Empire State Building and Chrysler Building are well-known examples of this style. It is already interesting that the story is put in different axes of time and space, but it is especially fascinating as Rigoletto was originally written in 1851 by Giuseppe Verdi, there was no way that Verdi himself could not have understood the contexts of Sher’s production.

## The Time went by so Fast

The 2 hours 40 minutes felt like a blink of an eye... The acoustic of the actors’ singing and the orchestra was extremely pleasant. My brain was in ecstasy (Is it too much to say this? I don’t have other vocabularies). Nowadays, we all almost always listen to digitised music, and most of us have forgotten how sounds in inaudible frequencies make a significant difference in our auditory experience. I really should appreciate every microsecond of opportunities where I get to hear great performance in a venue every little piece of which is designed to enhance it.

My seat was in the 10th row, and I was able to see the whole stage and decently see the facial expression of the actors (Another shout-out to Rush Tickets!). The stage set was gorgeous. There was a multi-facet building, which turns into a wide range of key architechtures in the story from the fancy Duke's residence to Rigoletto's average looking house. It was gigantic as it  was high as the ceiling and was spinning at a fairly fast speed (appx. 10 seconds/spin) with as many as 50 actors on it. It was funny to later find a critique’s comment in a review on the Wall Street Journal I read on the way home that said the turning set “supplies some drama, but more often distraction. Upstaging the singers at critical moments”. 

Although I thought I did not know any music from Rigoletto, I definitely recognised “Le donna è mobile” straight away. The aria has a catchy melody, and I’m sure many people would recognise it too. Another highlight from the night “Bella figlia dell’amore”, a quartet sang in Act 3. As a vocal harmony lover, Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys has been my inspiration, but from now on I will definitely start learning from these beautiful opera songs too.

## Summary

Overall, my first opera experience was a fabulous one, and I’m already aiming at the next week’s “Le Nozze di Figaro”. I personally strongly recommend anyone interested in seeing an opera try out rush tickets options, especially if you live in the city and can make it to the Lincoln Center after work or school.
